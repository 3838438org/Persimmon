==================

Problem
-------
Machine Learning is a multi-disciplinary subject. Because of this learners come from a variety of backgrounds,
and the mastering process can be though, specially when some of these backgrounds don't have strong programming foundations.

Approaches
---------
A visual interface for programming could help easing the steep learning curve, focusing on the methods, the intuition and
their connections instead on the technicals details of the underlying library.

Possible Outcomes
-----------------
* Greater engagement than traditional coding
* Similar engagement than traditional coding
* Less engagement than traditional coding

Each of these outcomes can occur for the same project based on the user background.

Experimentation
---------------
The ideal experimentation would include trials with subjects from the following backgrounds
* Statistics
* Mahematics
* Physics/Engineering
* CS
* Others (Business, etc...)

Trials would be based on
* A/B Testing based on different interfaces paradigms (Including no visual interface at all)
* Focus groups with iterative feedback that can influence development
