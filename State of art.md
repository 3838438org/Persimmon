##Chapter zero: The state of art
In this chapter we will try to explain the main ideas and reasons behind our research project and the main tecnologies behind it.
First of all we knew we wanted to do something related to data science so we started looking around what we could do that is some different
to what already exist outhere.
We found that there weren't many open source sotwares with a high level of complexity and at the same time being
easy to use so anyone even without having a deep knowledge in data science could use it.
Here is where we thought about contacting the "_e-learning UCM_" research group at our university because we saw an oportunity to bring the
power of the data science to the educational world, in this case via the educative games. We thought that was a perfect idea because we will
try to help them with a tool to easily meassure if the educational-games were getting to where they are expected to meaning if they are really helping 
to teach their users what they are supposed to.
