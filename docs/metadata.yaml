abstract: > 
    Persimmon is a visual programming interface that leverages scikit-learn to
    provide a drag and drop interface for developing Machine Learning and 
    Data Mining pipelines. It is based on the dataflow programming principles,
    giving the user a functional visual language with a type safety system that
    checks connections at write time, non-strict evaluation, task
    parallelization, and execution visualization.
