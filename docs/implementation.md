Implementation
==============

First Iteration
---------------
For the first iteration the priority was to get a proof of concept in order to
see where the difficulties can appear, with a few simple classificators and
cross-validation techniques.

Apart from the temporary interface the backend had to be built, because only
the simplest workflows were being supported no remarkable difficulties were
found. However we limited the estimators to classifiers only, as including
regressors and clusterings complicated things, as the interfaces are not
compatible.
