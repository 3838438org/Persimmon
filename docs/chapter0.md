Chapter zero
============


State-of-the-art
----------------
In this chapter we will try to explain the main ideas and reasons behind our
research project and the main tecnologies behind it.  
First of all we knew we wanted to do something related to data science so we 
started looking around what we could do that is some different to what already 
exist outhere.  
We found that there weren't many open source sotwares with a high level of 
complexity and at the same time being easy to use so anyone even without having
a deep knowledge in data science could use it.  
Here is where we thought about contacting the "_e-learning UCM_" research group 
at our university because we saw an oportunity to bring the power of the data 
science to the educational world, in this case via the educative games. We 
thought that was a perfect idea because we will try to help them with a tool 
that makes easy to meassure if the educational-games were getting to where they 
are expected to, meaning if they are really helping to teach their users what 
they are supposed to. At the same time we finally decided to make our project 
open souce since many educational games do not have a big budget and in this way
our programm would be accesible to all of them and they can even tweak some 
parts of our project if they really need to.  
  
Here is where we started thinking about which tecnology to use and the first 
part was very clear, we both have already worked with Python for data science 
in the past and we thought it has a quite good environment for it, but our main
goal for the project was to give all the power of the data science to people 
that may have rarely been working with data science so we needed to find a way 
of representing it so it was easy to understand and use. So after looking for 
several Python UI libraries we finally chose _kivy_ because we thought it could
fit quite well with what we want to do.  
The last remaining thing to do before starting with the project itself was to 
think in which way we would like to represent the information because for our 
purpose of doing a verty accesible and easy to use understand and use program 
that part was very important. The main idea we got to was an interface in which
you have all the different data science algorithms and just by dragging and 
droping them you can build build more complicated algorithms by concatenating 
them. At the same time you can configure each of the algorithms that you drag to
have the desired parameters. In this part we got the idea by looking at the 
Microsoft Azure plattform that in a sense is some similar to what we want to do
when talking about the interface. We thought that was a really good way of 
handling the several machine learning algorithms and it makes it so easy to add
new ones, or to move them from one place to another, but at the same time we saw
an opportunity to improve the part that we really donÂ´t like about
microsoft Azure plattform and this part is that the whole computation is done in
the "cloud", meaning this at the Microsoft servers and we wanted to give the 
whole power to the actual end user.
