Here is where we thought about contacting the *"e-learning UCM"* research group
at Complutense University because we saw an opportunity to bring the power of
the datascience to the educational world, in this case via the educative games.

We thought this would be a good stress test for the software, and giving
investigators that may not be datascience experts the ability to measure if
serious games were achieving their purposes, meaning if they are really
helping to teach their users what they are supposed to.

It was an obvious decision to make it Open Source, many of the tools we use are
Open source, and it was the ability to engage with them the reason that we
have become Computer Scientist.

This helps many educational games do not have a big budget and in this
way our program would be accessible to all of them and they can even tweak some
parts of the software if they really need to.

Here is where we started thinking about which technology to use and Python was
the obvious choice in order to keep all the project on the same language.

So after looking for several Python UI libraries `kivy` seemed the most
appropriate UI framework.
