Milestones
==========


In order to guarantee the delivery of the software a incremental software
development has been chosen, this implies breaking down the objectives into
smaller milestones that can be reached more easily, so in case the last
milestone isn ot reached there is still a substancial product to submit.

**Capped** is more than a minimum viable product, a extensive proof-of-concept,
with a few limited algorithms and the ability of inputing `.csv` files, with a
restricted interface in which we don't drag & drop algorithms but merely select
buttons.

**Parity** means a more or less complete parity in terms of features and visual
interaction. It is not very important to have the same number of
underlying algorithms because that's not the focus of the project.

And the final milestone is **Compilation**, the ability to get the python
source code from the visual representation, also improving the interface to
have a better flow, such as in unreal blueprints, which provide a very
intuitive interface [@shah2014mastering].

This milestone would bring Persimmon utility outside just the realm of
learning, as it would be a convenient tool for the exploratory work of any
ML solution (Business case, a Kaggle[^kaggle] competition, etc...

Out of scope, but possible further applications of the system are **web/junyper**
integration that means the system would be accessible from a website interface,
and script **synthesization**, which is the opposite of compilation, meaning
the ability to visualize on persimmon a python source file.

With the settled milestones a Gantt diagram of the project development can be
drawn.
